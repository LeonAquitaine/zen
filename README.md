Zen is platform-independent .NET Core middleware that simplifies the implementation of data-driven, API-focused apps.

## Yet another do-it-all framework? Really?

Not quite. Zen provides several features like ORM, caching, encryption and RESTful endpoints out of the box with zero setup in some cases. Think of it like a drop-in package set that'll get your app working with persistent storage to REST endpoints in no time and with minimal scaffolding.

Its core aspect is the ability to handle data for multiple connectors at the same time, regardless of the target database: Both relational and document (no-SQL) models are supported.
